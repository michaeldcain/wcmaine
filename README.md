WordCamp Maine Theme
=======

Let's use this to collaborate on what our local WordCamp site will look like. The theme site has been saved as a back up, but we'll only be able to change a single CSS file on the live WordCamp site. For our purposes, its found in twentyfourteen/css/custom-css.css.

Anticipated Completion date is Friday May 2nd.
